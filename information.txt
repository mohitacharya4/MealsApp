1. To enable navigation in react-native app we are going to install a package (https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/):
    a .npm install @react-navigation/native

    b. As, we are using expo, the setup is very simple as we only need to do the following installation as well:
        i. npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context

    c. We will use native stack for navigation:
        i. expo install @react-navigation/native-stack
